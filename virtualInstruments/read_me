a #Playing Notes, detailed instruction
write an html page with javascript that creates buttons and sounds for a waveform representative of flute sound. there should be seven buttons for playing each note. can do a square wave or triangle wave or do another instrument like piano.


b #Displaying and Saving Notes, Adding Functionality
in the above html page, add these things: a window where the notes one plays are concatenated and displayed with 16 notes per line, then move to the next line, the ability to download a csv file for the notes that are played, use a teal and gray highlights theme, dark theme


c #Minimal direction and more abstract instruction
create the ability to play up to 3 notes at a time, and expand the keys to span 3 octaves

d #User Friendliness of Playing the Keys
instead of laying out the keys in an array with 3 rows, make them all in one line, and long and thin, with longer being the vertical direction on the screen. can you make them play if the mouse slides over the key instead of clicking?


e #Enhance Functionality
can you make it so each virtual instrument has its own row if the user wants, so user can play more than one instrument without toggle
